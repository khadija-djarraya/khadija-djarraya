## Hi there 👋
I'm Khadija Djarraya

🌍 Tunisian software engineer — born in Saudi Arabia, shaped by Tunisia, and now based in Bahrain.

💻 I build user-focused web-apps and enjoy exploring Cloud, Fog computing, and IoT (shoutout to **iFogSim**!).

🌱 I care deeply about accessibility, clean UX, and writing code that makes sense, not just to machines, but to people too.
